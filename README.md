## 🛠️ Why I Built This
- I wanted an AI assistant I could actually trust and use daily.
- I don’t want cloud APIs, accounts, or background uploads.
- This project explores what a **local-first AI assistant** feels like on a personal computer.

## 🧩 Features
- 🧠 Local LLM via Ollama (offline, no API key)
- 🪟 Desktop-native window (always available, non-intrusive)
- 🗂️ Local memory (stored on device)
- 🔒 No cloud, no telemetry, no background upload

## ▶️ Download & Install
- Windows / macOS installer
- Requires Ollama installed locally

## 🧠 How It Works (Short Version)
This app communicates with Ollama via a local HTTP API.
All conversations and memory stay on your machine.

> No data leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to.

## ⚠️ Notes
- This is a personal tool built for daily use.
- Model behavior depends on the model you choose in Ollama.
